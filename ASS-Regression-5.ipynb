    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression. It aims to address the limitations of these two methods. Like Lasso, Elastic Net can perform variable selection and handle multicollinearity, and like Ridge, it can mitigate the problem of overfitting. It achieves this by adding both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties to the regression objective function, allowing it to strike a balance between the two. This means that Elastic Net can shrink coefficients towards zero and encourage some coefficients to be exactly zero, making it suitable for both feature selection and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Ridge and Lasso, the optimal values of the regularization parameters (α and λ) in Elastic Net Regression can be chosen through techniques like cross-validation. You can perform a grid search over a range of α (mixing parameter between L1 and L2 penalties) and λ (regularization strength) values. Use k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model for each combination of α and λ and select the combination that yields the best cross-validation performance (e.g., lowest mean squared error).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Elastic Net:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handles multicollinearity.\n",
    "Can perform variable selection by driving some coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "Balances L1 and L2 penalties, providing a flexible regularization approach.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "May still retain some drawbacks of Lasso and Ridge, such as the need to choose optimal regularization parameters.\n",
    "For very high-dimensional data, it might select too many variables or none at all, depending on the chosen α.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are some common use cases for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is particularly useful when you have a dataset with many correlated variables and you want to achieve a balance between regularization and feature selection. Common use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "High-dimensional datasets with potential multicollinearity.\n",
    "When you want to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.\n",
    "When you suspect that many of the features may not be relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting coefficients in Elastic Net is similar to interpreting coefficients in ordinary linear regression. Larger coefficients still indicate stronger relationships between the predictor and the response variable. However, due to the combined L1 and L2 penalties, some coefficients may be exactly zero, indicating that those features are effectively excluded from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling missing values is important in any regression technique, including Elastic Net. You can handle missing values by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputing them with mean, median, or other appropriate values.\n",
    "Using advanced imputation techniques like regression imputation.\n",
    "Treating missing values as a separate category (for categorical variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How do you use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net inherently performs feature selection by encouraging some coefficients to become exactly zero. The α parameter controls the balance between L1 and L2 penalties, which affects the sparsity of the solution. Higher values of α lead to more coefficients being pushed to zero, performing stronger feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How do you pickle and unpickle a trained Elastic Net Regression model in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",

    "You can use the pickle module in Python to serialize (pickle) and deserialize (unpickle) a trained Elastic Net Regression model. Here's a basic example:"
